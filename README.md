# My Emoji Finder

This project was my first COMPLETED project with React granted that my other ideas had a dead end. This may have been a dead end also. I was stuck on on line for about a week lol.

## What was new to me?

- JSX syntax
- using `npm` commands
- `useState` hook
- completing an application from beginning to end
- using handleChanges as well as `event.target.value`
- importing and exporting components

## I am proud of ...

- I am now fully confident using `array.map` and `array.filter`
- I thought I lost myself midway through the project but now that it's complete, I know what I need to work on

## I should work on ...

Although I have learnt these, I was hoping to use these more ...

- useMemo
- useEffect
- array.reduce
- array.index
- useRef
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useContext
- useReducer

## I still don't understand ...

- line 8-12 in App.js
 `    const handleClick = (id) => {
        setMyStyle((prevState) => ({
            ...myStyle,
            [id]: !prevState[id],
        }));
    };`
    
- how to effectively structure my componenents
